# Scene 1
doc.add_heading('Scene 1: Local Clinic', level=1)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "Environment: The clinic is still small and outdated, with the same atmosphere (beige walls, old posters, flickering lights), "
    "but now, stress increases gradually as the player waits and interacts. Visual cues for stress: the lighting grows harsher, and "
    "background noise increases as the stress score rises.\n"
    "Gameplay/Interaction:\n"
    "- Stress Mechanic: The longer the player waits, the more their stress score increases. Short, unhelpful responses from the doctor "
    "will also increase stress.\n"
    "- Success Mechanic: The success percentage begins low but can be improved by selecting detailed descriptions of symptoms and pushing "
    "for further tests. The doctor’s uncertainty will mean success rates rise minimally in this scene."
)

doc.add_heading('Dialogue Tree:', level=2)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "Doctor: 'What brings you in today?'\n"
    "- Player options:\n"
    "  1. 'I’ve been feeling really weak, and I don’t know why.' (neutral stress)\n"
    "  2. 'I’m exhausted all the time, and my joints hurt. It’s getting worse.' (small success increase)\n"
    "  3. 'No one can figure out what’s wrong with me. I need help!' (raises stress but increases success rate more)"
)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "Doctor: 'That could be a number of things. I’ll prescribe some painkillers. Rest and come back if it persists.'\n"
    "- Player options:\n"
    "  1. 'That’s it? Can’t we run more tests?' (raises success rate slightly, small stress increase)\n"
    "  2. 'Painkillers won’t solve this! What’s really going on?' (high stress, but higher success rate)\n"
    "  3. 'I’ll just leave, then.' (decreases success, minimal stress)"
)

# Scene 2
doc.add_heading('Scene 2: Specialist Office', level=1)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "Environment: The specialist’s office is sleek, modern, and cold. The sterile environment heightens the player’s feeling of alienation. "
    "As stress builds, the medical images and digital screens can flicker or blur. Success is tied more heavily to player choices in this scene.\n"
    "Gameplay/Interaction:\n"
    "- Stress Mechanic: The sterile, overwhelming environment, and complex medical jargon can increase stress, especially if the player feels lost. "
    "Asking the doctor to “simplify” explanations can mitigate stress, but might slow the success rate.\n"
    "- Success Mechanic: Making informed decisions (choosing which tests to pursue) will gradually increase the success rate. Incorrect choices (choosing "
    "irrelevant tests) may cause stress to rise without significant progress."
)

doc.add_heading('Dialogue Tree:', level=2)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "Specialist: 'I’ve reviewed your results from the clinic. It’s still unclear, but let’s discuss your symptoms.'\n"
    "- Player options:\n"
    "  1. 'I think it might be an autoimmune disease. Could we investigate that?' (boosts success, small stress increase)\n"
    "  2. 'I’m scared. I don’t understand what’s happening.' (lower stress, small success increase)\n"
    "  3. 'Just give me something to stop the pain!' (high stress, minimal success)"
)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "Specialist: 'We could do some blood work, or schedule an MRI. What do you think?'\n"
    "- Player options:\n"
    "  1. 'Let’s do the MRI. I need answers.' (boosts success, moderate stress)\n"
    "  2. 'Blood work is fine. Let’s start there.' (moderate success, minimal stress)\n"
    "  3. 'What do you think is the best approach?' (small success boost, lowers stress)"
)

# Scene 3
doc.add_heading('Scene 3: Community Health Center', level=1)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "Environment: This setting is bustling but friendly, contrasting with the coldness of the specialist’s office. Bright colors and warm lighting "
    "help reduce stress, though the chaotic environment can sometimes increase it when the player feels overwhelmed. Conversations with NPCs, like "
    "other patients or the social worker, are key to progression.\n"
    "Gameplay/Interaction:\n"
    "- Stress Mechanic: Interactions here have a calming effect, but certain conversations or feeling misunderstood by the community health worker "
    "could increase stress.\n"
    "- Success Mechanic: Finding alternative treatments (optional) or joining the support group can slightly boost success by introducing new perspectives or hidden clues about the illness."
)

doc.add_heading('Dialogue Tree:', level=2)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "Social Worker: 'I understand you’ve been going through a tough time. Let’s talk about your symptoms.'\n"
    "- Player options:\n"
    "  1. 'It’s exhausting, physically and emotionally. Nothing is working.' (lowers stress, small success boost)\n"
    "  2. 'I’m frustrated. I’ve seen so many doctors.' (increases stress, moderate success boost)\n"
    "  3. 'Do you know anyone who’s been through something like this?' (boosts success, slight stress reduction)"
)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "Social Worker: 'We offer some alternative treatments here, or I can refer you to a support group. What would you like to try?'\n"
    "- Player options:\n"
    "  1. 'Let’s try some alternative treatments.' (side quest unlocks, small success boost)\n"
    "  2. 'I’d rather talk to others who are going through the same thing.' (boosts success and lowers stress)\n"
    "  3. 'Neither, I just need more tests.' (small success, moderate stress)"
)

# Scene 4
doc.add_heading('Scene 4: Emergency Room', level=1)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "Environment: The emergency room is loud and chaotic, with bright overhead lights, constant beeping, and rushed nurses and doctors. "
    "The stress level here spikes dramatically, with high-intensity situations, time pressure, and confusion. The player’s health is deteriorating, "
    "making every choice feel urgent.\n"
    "Gameplay/Interaction:\n"
    "- Stress Mechanic: The chaotic environment and urgent nature of the scene result in high stress. Quick decision-making is necessary, and the player must balance the stress mechanic against the need to act.\n"
    "- Success Mechanic: Success is now tied heavily to whether the player has been able to piece together enough clues in previous scenes. Conversations with the ER doctor and the specialist can yield the final breakthroughs."
)

doc.add_heading('Dialogue Tree:', level=2)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "ER Doctor: 'We need to move fast. Tell me what’s been happening.'\n"
    "- Player options:\n"
    "  1. 'It’s all happening so fast… I don’t know.' (high stress, low success)\n"
    "  2. 'I think it might be an autoimmune condition. My specialist wasn’t sure.' (moderate stress, high success)\n"
    "  3. 'I’ve had unexplained fever and joint pain for weeks. This isn’t just an emergency!' (boosts success significantly, increases stress)"
)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "ER Doctor: 'We need to run tests. What do you suggest? Blood work or imaging?'\n"
    "- Player options:\n"
    "  1. 'Imaging is faster. Let’s do that.' (moderate success, high stress)\n"
    "  2. 'Start with blood work. It’s what they’ve done before.' (small success, lowers stress)\n"
    "  3. 'I don’t know, just do something!' (high stress, low success)"
